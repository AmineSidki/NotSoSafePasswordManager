As its desription states, this "project" was made in an afternoon using Java and JavaFX for the GUI. It is quite straightforward, it stores your passwords into a local SQLite database and when you need them you can just copy them to the clipboard with a click.  
</p>
<br>
<p>
Its main purpose was to evaluate how I am still holding when it comes to JavaFX and I didn't feel like making an n-th to-do list application or calculator.  
</p>
<br>
But ladies and gentlemen, I am no longer going to use JavaFX for the simple reason that that piece of garbage is so deprecated, it doesn't even package into a .jar file !  
For a frontend framework that boasts about being so modern, having a weird flavour of PROPRIETARY CSS and markup language is not enough to achieve said modernity!  
As much as I hate flutter, it has been at least able to package. Even if it hasn't been the most consistent either.

>[!TIP]
>As the deprecated trash that is javaFX doesn't want to compile into a working jar, if for any reason you want to use this application, you will have to run it using the following command in the project's root :   
>
>``` ./mvnw javafx:run```
